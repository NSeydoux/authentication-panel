## Auth Upgrade Proposal
 - https://github.com/solid/authentication-panel/issues/45
 - Jackson: Inrupt commits resounces to get it done. We are about to release solid-auth-fetcher.
 - Jackson: I will work on updating all inrupt supported tooling using solid-auth client.
 - ...: Building support for NSS
 - Elf: It's may be jumping a bit, but there is an issue of using http2 instead of websockets. In that case we could use the regular authentication authorization for other requests. So does this library support streaming
 - Jackson: Curently doesn't suppor it. 
 - Elf: There's no additional auth requirements for streaming. We just need to change how the streaming body is handled.
 - Elf: Just keep it in mind that you would want to get the body of the response as stream.
 - Jackson: It has same interface as native `fetch`, and you receive response with the same inteface.
 - ...: Doesn't server need to be changed?
 - Elf: Yes, server needs to be able to stream response and we need define format and maybe media type.
 - Jackson: Clients uses VC to authenticate with the resource server. Eventually we could expand ACL to rely on Verifiable Credentials.
 - Henry: I would like to research using VCs in access control. Eg. anyone who had covid test with negative result can access this resource.
 - Elf: I think we need to address earlier. If we just use Id Credential, we need to ask a question about what are the default client capabilities. So, we start with no access then a client can present that you have full access. So, coming from that, I still don't think we should allow you to pass the identity credential. I think we should have capability credentials which says "Full access" or "restricted access." And I don't think we should use identity credential and leave implicit what are the capabilities of the client.
 - Jackson: By default the client could do nothing, and you need to change ACL to allow client to do something.
 - Elf: Resoruce controller or the user would need to change something?
 - Jackson: It comes back to converstation from last week where in enterprise environment resource controller would stay responsible for restricting access. Eg. my aunt has a photo, i can go and edit it using editing app, i would need to tell my aunt that i want to access it with specific app.
 - ...: On the other hand, if financial company exposes data to me, and i want to use an app which the company wants to control. I had suggestions that having that we don't need to have user controlled client restrictions.
 - Henry: I see enterpises just as the same situation as any other networks. In a project we submited to EU some years ago, we had example of BMW having problem with managing suplain chain. They had 500k actors in the system. Similar with many just-in-time manufacturing companies. In those scenarios having resource controller maintaining client restrictions can add significant cost.
 - Jackson: In open community we will have cases: "I share this resource with specific people and trust them with choice of the clients they will access that resource with."
 - Henry: My launcher app proposal aims at addressing this use case.
 - Elf: Similar concept of Capabilities Provider appearing in various conversation as interated with Identity Provider.
 - Elf: If we have 1.0 relying on only identity credentials, we won't be able to do capabilities for the client. So for 1.0 we need to address the default capabilities of the application.
 - Jackson: I understand that it's better to wait with the upgrade until we clarify user restirting clients and clients presenting capability credentials.

## Henry's Blogpost
 - [Co-Immunology and the Web](https://medium.com/@bblfish/co-immunology-and-the-web-43379b46688e) blog post on thinking of the web and solid in immunological terms.
 - Henry: We had this virus and I've been following a number of philosophers. I've always wanted to bring this immunilogical stance into access control. So, there are 3 parts to the post:
     - What did we learn from the virus. It's small, it comes through the air channels. The system is small. And you have to wash your hands wear a mask, and self isolate. But you still need the whole society to work for food and medication. So, you can see the immunilogical system isn't just at the body level, it's also at the social and international level. So we have a global response to a virus which is a little piece of data.
     - I wanted people to start thinking of security not just at a local level but at the social level. You're always co-dependent on others. Not completely dependent, but there's a co-dependence in which the social system needs to be safe where the individual is safe, and vice versa.
     - Then I look at immunology in the web. You have all these peer to peer companies that needed to be part of building this internet. And if you had it centralized in one place, it wouldn't have functioned. So, you need a decentralized open system for it to work. The linking is the important thing there. It's kind of trust that you have that people won't change the data. At the beginning of the web there was work similar to washing hands by ensuring that you only link to people you respected. Then I look at the blogosphere and the fact that you needed to deal with spam. Which is how platforms like facebook came to be. The problem with facebook is for people to post content. Also there are many organizations that can't join facebook. So solid can do this because it allows you to post data on your own system with access control. So, this system allows you to connect to others more quickly which is much bigger and vaster than what Facebook is able to do. We still have problems of trust with the linkage. If you fetch content you should be able to cache it locally. You might also want links with versions in the links so you can verify it with cached versions, and IPFS does this too a little bit.
