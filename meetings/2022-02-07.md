#### Trust model for WebID services and OIDC Providers

- TH: We (Digita) are deploying a WebID service: https://www.use.id/. Some questions are popping up, and different authentication requirements are requested based on the type of data the client wants to access.
- AC: This is an interesting use case for both AuthN and AuthZ. You may have proven that you own an identity, but the RS may not trust a given OIDC-provider. Solid Identity is based on the WebID, which adds an indirection layer between the user identity and their OIDC Provider. A single WebID may trust two different OIDC issuers, or several OP one by one over time. Per-resource restrictions may also be expressed so that only some OPs will be trusted to issue tokens giving access to said resource.
- TH: Some elements which often come up about what makes an OIDC issuer trustworthy is: MFA and actual identity verification. Would there be a way to abstract this at the protocol layer ?
- AC: This is a question of trust. What entity makes claims, and who do you trust about these claims ? Let's say you have an ID token which features a "MFA" claim. Nothing prevents an OIDC Provider to make this claim without any basis. Anyone could create their own OP and make any number of claims, which means eventually, the question is about trusting the OP making these claims. There are two levels where this is relevant: 
    - operational level: specify an allowlist of trusted OP from the Authorization Server (AS). Solid is built for an open ecosystem, and this tends to make it into a federation where you restrict who you trust.
    -  access control level: (ACP has a mechanism for this) the user may add policies in their access control resources to control who the trusted OPs are
-  TH: we want to find a good balance between UX and security. Allowing to trust any OP for some data is fine, but it's sort of overkill if the user need to manually trust each OP. Day one, already WebID with multiple IdP
-  AC: This is a fundamental question. One pattern which exists out there is to have adaptative mode. If you typically log if from a certain place and time, and you suddenly log in from a very different place at unusual time, then you have additional poof of identity to provide comapred to a typical login.
-  WT: On both the operational and AC level, the OP can be restricted. However, from a UX and extensibility standpoint, if an app needs to add issuers manually to the allowlist of issuers, that's problematic. If a class of issuers (e.g. OIDC federations) would be defined, then it would be a better UX/DX.
-  AC: Federation seems indeed like a good fit for that use case. Federation is a different flavor of decentralization, with some centralized decision-making. Digita could certify a group of OPs, and allow certain OPs based on this. Then, the validation can bleed into the user experience by giving additional info in the UI. A third party (the federated authority) ends up certifying the OP, which improves the trust model. Another way for discovery is to extend OP metadata (.well-known/openid-configuration). A federation certifying OPs would be a good model in your case. This certification process could also apply to clients (apps). 
-  TH: A EU framework for identity providers: https://ec.europa.eu/cefdigital/wiki/display/CEFDIGITAL/eIDAS+Levels+of+Assurance
-  AC: The scope of the directions in this area is quite broad, mostly for a lack of implementation experience. Once the ecosystem matures, there will be a much more broad look at these questions, and certification and trust will be central questions.
