## Minutes

### Discussing JSON-LD context PR

**Elf**: not so clear of EricP's point. Perhaps he can make a new PR for that improvement?

**Aaron**: will add that note to PR
   Aaron quickly explains for Justin the reasons 
   for the PR, regarding having JSON literal inside 
   of the RDF.

**Henry**: the problem was that there was "linked data" 
   content in the JSON literal embedded in RDF, which is a bit weird. It is better if we can have a format that looks like JSON but also treats linked data in an RDF-compatible way. Hence the idea of moving to JSON-LD.
   In the case of HttpSig, which now also has JSON embedded in the data, this is a literal JWK key. Building a whole ontology for crypto is a lot of work, and since it is a literal, I think it is ok to leave it that way in the RDF.
   
*Discussion on the vocabulary relating to consent screens.*

### [Multiple WWW-Authenticate headers](https://github.com/solid/authentication-panel/issues/163)

**Henry**: if a resource server wants to allow both HTTPSig and Solid-OIDC it may be tricky to combine it in a single WWW-Authenticate header.
**Aaron**: I don't see problems with multiple WWW-Authenticate headers. Problems may come if we try to use multiple Authorization headers. The questions that arise are: should the server verify all of the tokens or only some? 
**Henry**: I don't think this issue is crucial right now, but since we do have HttpSig and OIDC as well as Basic, it will pop up. So I thought it would be good to gather the things to think about someplace.

### [Sending Access control rules in the body of 401?](https://github.com/solid/authentication-panel/issues/167)

**Pavlik**: There is a problem here when accessing resources directly in the browser, as these need to be displayed in HTML. I want to make primer PR relating to accessing resources directly with a browser. It would put some requirements on what 401 response should include (edit: at least for `text/html`)
**Aaron**: I would be careful about privacy with returning that information.
  Back in the days, during login, sites would respond with 'bad password' or 'unknown username'. Now they just reject and don't leak any information related to user accounts.
**Henry**: yes, I am not too keen on putting ACL data in the body of a 401 for the reasons given above. I just thought it would be worth gathering those thoughts, as it is an option to consider.

### [Syntax for Realm?](https://github.com/solid/authentication-panel/issues/166)

**Aaron**: I would consider it archaic used mostly with Basic authentication. Most recent systems seem to ignore it.
   One sees it used in browsers for basic auth, where they display the realm text in the pop-up.

**Henry**: thanks, yes I was not sure if there was a good way to use those. I'll ignore them for now. But happy to hear of some good use for them. 

###  [PR on HTTPSig](https://github.com/solid/authentication-panel/pull/168)

Henry went over the changes gained from experience implementing HttpSig. He will finish the PR in the next few days.
