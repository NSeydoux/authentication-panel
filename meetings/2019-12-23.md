## Issues

### [Proposed Terminology section #35](https://github.com/solid/authentication-panel/pull/35)

 - Elf: Mostly I think we can address the solid pod terminology. From my understanding we can see that there are different interpretations of the solid pod. So that's why I proposed we don't use a normative pod term. It should just be a marketing term. So, solid storage should not include the OP functionality. Some people would include it and others wouldn't. So we can say "Solid storage" does not include the OP.

 - Elf: I think using "Pod" in the spec would be based on what we determine. If it's not specific enough we should not use it.
 - Elf: In other places the "controller" is used to describe "whoever has acl access control," So I think it's confusing to call it a "controller document". So if we use "resource controller" rather than "resource owner"
