## Minutes

### Any discussion/follow-ups to WICG/SolidCG meeting

Sarven: They added note to README mentioning name collision.
...: We should come back to them with what solid would need from web browsers. Create issue?

Henry: Good idea to create an issue. I need to first implement HTTPSig, ACLs, and then get to Credentials, before I can start constructively looking at how we could work together. So my guess is this will take 3 months before I can give an informed answer.

Pavlik: I would follow their work especially what they do with 'directed identifiers' (site specific ones)

Sarven: scope is identity/authentication but may even edgy stuff; native RDF parsing and serializing?

### [Proposal: change webid claim to solid #146](https://github.com/solid/authentication-panel/issues/146)

Aaron: we have some +1 on the issue. Pavlik suggested using IRIs for claim names and for scopes.
I generally don't see it in other systems but they can be used.
Pavlik: if we don't want to use IRI we would need to regsiter that JWT claim
Aaron: is solid is taking route of registering strings with IANA or using IRIs which we don't have to register
Sarven: I don't know if we have global position on it, we did it for `acl` which has a history. `describedby` is registered by LDP spec.
Aaron: In that case, if something we will change to using IRI sounds like linked data friendly approach.
Sarven: If we think it can be used beyond solid we could consider registering with IANA.
Henry: Moving from "WebID" to something more general such as "Solid" would be good if one had something more general, allowing one to try out different options such as use of Credentials. Just changing the name though does not give a more general protocol. To get that one would need to add some parameters and values to allow the client to know the difference. Without those features the change brings a semblance of generality without providing one. And one would need to have implementations make a change without a benefit to come with it.
...: I think JSON folks may at an IRI - in a position where a short attributes would have done just as well - as something odd or even weird.
Aaron: Those JWTs get sent with every authenticated request. Short claims like `iat` etc. allow more compact tokents. If we change it to IRI it takes more bytes.
Pavlik: scopes have ofte IRI as values. Also we had proposal to exchange bigger token for short token used on each request, this would also go along UMA2.0 approach with delegating claims gathering.
Aaron: Let's continue in issue.
Henry: It's really up to those implementing this to decide. I have not implemented the OIDC connect protocol, so please take my statements with a grain of salt there.


### [specify parameters in WWW-Authenticate header #152](https://github.com/solid/authentication-panel/issues/152)

Pavlik: ...
Aaron: I think it is important to have something in WWW-Authenticate header. Is the question what the structure of the fields are?
Henry: WWW-Authenticate has standard on what you can put in that response header
...: HTTP-Sig has also uses that header, and implementing that I found some new IETF spec giving advice on how to structure
those headers:
Sarven: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8941
Henry: https://www.fastly.com/blog/improve-http-structured-headers

### [Solid OIDC Conformance Classes #133](https://github.com/solid/authentication-panel/issues/133)

Sarven: We were discussing documenting implementation, we tried to identify what kinds
of implementation there are. Spec should indicate for each class what it needs to implement to conform.
Pavlik: I could take action to add that section to the spec. Basing it 


### [Clarifying specific areas of overlap with AuthZ #145](https://github.com/solid/authentication-panel/issues/145)

Aaron: if RS needs to provide link to AS, how this would work with solid
Pavlik: I mean AS associated with RS, distinct from IdP associated with user
Beno√Æt: As implementation its sometimes hard which pannel is responsible for which part
Clarifying the overlap would help on implementation side
Henry: In the HttpSig approach, there is a simple overlap: the ACR being accessbile to the client it is able to find out who has access in order to guide its decision on what credential to present (detailed argument moved to issue 145)

### [keyId's do not exactly refer to keys anymore #151](https://github.com/solid/authentication-panel/issues/151)

Henry: Sig headers have moved to the hs2019 algorithm, where the keyId has to specify both the key and other parameters such as sha516. As a result I think that the simple use of did:key I presented in the HTTPSig document does not work as simply as I assumed (it depends on what is in a did:key of course)

## Actions

* Open issue or tag to collect ideas that can be brought to them in 3 months or so.
* Pavlik: create PR with conformance classes
