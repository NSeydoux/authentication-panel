## Issues

### [(WIP) Tokens and Credentials section. #37](https://github.com/solid/authentication-panel/pull/37)

- Dmitri: we discussed it last week
- Jackson: we need to prioirtize replacement for trusted apps, I think client capabilities should solve it

### [User designating multiple OPs to issue capability credentials #59](https://github.com/solid/authorization-and-access-control-panel/issues/59)

- Jackson: We assume that capability credentials get included in the token. RS would look at issuer of specific token. We can ignore any other OP.
- Dmitri: When user has multiple OPs in their profile. RS when verifying tokens they need to check that any of them issued it. I think capability credentials don't seem to change much. User not OP issues them. I see no reason of multiple OPs to re prompt user.
- elf-pavlik: I don't see big difference between identity credential and capability credentials.
- Jackson: Let's step back and talk about multiple OPs in general. If user lists multiple ones, RS would look at them as OR, it doesn't require coordinating between them.
- bblfish: User may have multiple identities...
- elf-pavlik: we discuss case of user having one identity but using multiple OP.
- Dmitri: now one can use 'external WebID' and use it with more than one storage. WebID profile would have a statement with `solid:oidcProvider` for each one.
- Dmitri: With Client Capability Credentails we need to answer where they get stored. Some web applications have backend persistence. SPA/PWA which don't have storage may work different.
- Jackson: can we use localstorage? just as we store authentication token.
- Dmitri: User authentication should stay short lived than app capabilities. But I think they can use the same capabilities.
- elf-pavlik: on different device app could end up using different OP.
- Dmitri: User should not care which OP they use.
- Jackson: So storage could get provided by user but not by OP.
- jamiefiedler: If OP A goes down and OP B gets used. It may require extra consent of permision, but if you revoke on A and than it folls back to B you still have permissions there.
- elf-pavlik: result of consent screen wouldn't be signed, just used by OPs to issue capability credentials.


### [Client Capabilities: Verifiable Credential Proofs vs. Special discoverable prefix in storage #60](https://github.com/solid/authorization-and-access-control-panel/issues/60)

- elf-pavlik: @zenomt suggests to just have discoverable prefix and if capabilities are published there RS can trust them. It also requires container storing those capabilities not to allow listing its content.
- bblfish: we should have protocol where client can pass capabilities by value or reference.

- elf-pavlik: questions:
1. does result of consent screen gets used across OPs
2. do we use that result as credential or as source of knowledge for each OP to issue credential

- Dmitri: I think credentail could be shared across OPs. I think User will sign credential not the OP.
- bblfish: sounds like my launcher app proposal
- Dmitri: I think of something simpler
- elf-pavlik: how this would work across devices?
- Dmitri: encrypted chats like signal, whatsapp, telegram etc. they replicate keys and allow user to password encrypt them.
- Dmitri: they also allow to register multiple devices.
- elf-pavlik: I don't see advantage over letting OP sign the credential.
- Dmitri: I think we may need it anyways. Possibly to early to decide.
- bblfish: I wrote application which would create its own key. We just need to tie them to webid.
- elf-pavlik: any thoughts on self-issued OIDC and how capabilities fit there?
- bblfish: dmv issues you a driver license...
- elf-pavlik: we discuss user issuing capability credential to the application
- elf-pavlik: i think we need to have sender constrained credentials.
