# 2019-08-12 Authentication Panel

## General ideas for improvement

*  Formalize the PoP token standard
*  Find the correct approach to do multi-RS authentication (try to make it as close to what currently exists)
*  Use of self signed authentication (without an identity provider)
*  Document differences between in-browser apps and services
*  Interop with other decentralized auth
*  DID Auth
*  Multi User Device auth (with alternative sensors ie no keyboard or mouse)
*  Biometrics authentication
*  Opaque authentication (accept claims without telling a resource server who you are)
*  Verifiable claims (property based authentication)
*  WebAuthn
*  WebID-TLS
*  HTTP2 enabled?
*  WebSocket authentication
*  Interop with SAML and ActiveDirectory (Other IDPs)
*  Keeping Storage system implementations simple (Don't have a ton of different ways for storage servers to confirm identity)
