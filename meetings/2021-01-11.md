### Accessing resources outside of the App

Aaron explained a system used in Inrupt
they are using in order to view resources outside of an App. (Editor: Not able to duplicate what was said here). That feature is somewhat unstable so no documentation yet.

### Core-Auth

Henry: What could be a core part of solid-oidc? How would the minimal auth protocol described in [HttpSig proposal sketch](
 https://github.com/bblfish/authentication-panel/blob/master/HttpSignature.md) from last year fit? (Note HTTP-Sig is now worked on at IETF as [Signing HTTP Messages](https://greenbytes.de/tech/webdav/draft-ietf-httpbis-message-signatures-01.html))
 
Dmitri:   These two specs tie in nicely with the HTTP Message Signing IETF work and would be worth looking at to see how it ties in with the above proposal:
 + [DPOP](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-fett-oauth-dpop-04) used by solid-oidc
 + [GNAP]( https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-gnap-core-protocol/) 
 
Aaron: pointed in gitter to [oauth.xyz](https://oauth.xyz/) 

Dmitri: the oauth.xyz is now covered by the gnap and dpop (editor: did I understand correctly?)

## Actions

Editors:  Determine identifier and title for the current `solid-oidc` spec

Everyone: go through issues and leave notes (tags) on those that can be closed.

Aaron: a sketch of how Inrupt has implemented the resource access outside of apps problem, as an issue.

Henry: to read DPOP, GNAP, and see how it integrates into HTTP-Sig (Core Auth) proposal.
