## Topics

### WWW-Authenticate header
URL: https://github.com/solid/solid-oidc/issues/25

* EP: The DPoP spec does not mention WWW-Authenticate. Mozilla MDN documentation of the Header gives some context about the Header. There seems to have no conter-ideication to use the `Solid-OIDC` scheme.
* AC: DPoP does describe a WWW-Authenticate header in a recent addition. In particular, it specifies a list of supported algorithms with an `algs:` scheme. The latest version of the DPoP draft is [available there](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-dpop-03).
* AC: We can talk more about this next week. Having a `solid:` scheme would be really helpful. Should we have a PROPOSAL defined perhaps next week?
* EP: Will review. Would we be limited by DPoP ?
* AC: one of the questions is, can you have multiple WWW-Authenticate ?
* EP: Yes, or also multiple schemes.
* AC: Multiple schemes would be appropriate here. 
* EP: You should just pick one scheme, and consider all the parameters available in this scheme, which means if there is overlap with DPoP it should be specified.



### Link Header discovery
URL: https://github.com/solid/solid-oidc/issues/32

* AC: This was part of the previous WebID-OIDC, as an option. It is still not mandatory, but a server serving a WebID may elect to specify which OIDC issuers are associated to a given WebID as part of the Link Headers. If the Link Headers are present, they should be canonical.
* EP: The Link Headers being optional, their presence cannot be mandatory, and thus they cannot be considered canonical if present because it would be legitimate for a client to entierly disregard them.
* AC: Agreed.
* EP: Only a full parse should be canonical, but the Link Headers can be offered as an optimization.

PROPOSAL: Move forward with OIDC providers being discoverable as part of optional Link Headers ? Discussion to continue in PR

* AC: +1
* eP: +1
* NAS: +1

ACTION: AC to PR.

### Reminder of outstanding actions from
* AC: Actions from [last week](https://github.com/solid/authentication-panel/blob/main/meetings/2021-09-27.md)
* AC: Will prioritize these this week.
* EP: I went through the Primer, and updated the examples so that the WebID terminology is no longer used (according to a previous decision of the panel). Discussion should carry on in the associated PRs.

### Test suite discussion

* AC: Reached out to the Test Suite panel to set up the discussion for next week. A draft hackmd should be created to prepare the discussion next time.
* EP: Prepare the agenda and prioritize the test suite discussion so that people only involved with this specific topic may leave early.

### Open questions

* EP: Think ahead of overlap between AuthN and AuthZ, and ensure that the WWW-Authenticate header won't be overloaded in these two contexts. 
* AC: One way to validate this involves being in sync with the other panels, especially AuthZ and interoperability. Should be a dedicated item in these other panels ?
* EP: We should try to keep panel work as independant as possible, but at the same time we cannot assume that there is no overlap between the different panels in these areas.
