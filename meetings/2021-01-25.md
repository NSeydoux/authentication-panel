### Discussion
* [Authorization Capabilities for Linked Data](https://github.com/solid/authorization-panel/issues/160)
 * Henry went over the issue started by Elf Pavlik, focusing in on the Sequence Diagram and how this extension of the 2019 [HTTP-Sig Authentication for Solid](https://github.com/bblfish/authentication-panel/blob/master/HttpSignature.md). The diagram here shows a 401 followed by an HTTP Signature signed header with an additional Credential header with a URL pointing to a possibly signed Verifiable Credential Document. The URL could be on an https URL, a did URL or even perhaps (see [question at the end of this comment](https://github.com/solid/authorization-panel/issues/160#issuecomment-766110578) a relative URL pointing to a resource in the browser).

  So this would allow authentication by attribute, if say the Credential is a birth certificate.
Thinking about this issue allowed me to see how this could also work for Delegation and Capabilities,
which I developed [in this comment](https://github.com/solid/authorization-panel/issues/160#issuecomment-765961645) using Elf's Omni Use Case. But that may more a matter for the authorization panel. Still the 
interesting thing is that pretty much the same protocol works in all these cases.

Henry felt this new thinking could allow him to develop the Authorization Capabilities for Linked Data proposal. So he asked the group if there were any things to consider or obvious flaws before trying to do this. 
 * Elf: was wondering if this could be integrated somehow with the current Solid-OIDC spec?
 * Henry: it might have commonalities (especially the signature verification part). But it may be worth starting out developing this proposal to see where it leads, and then trying to map the two together and find commonalities. The aim is here to see how simple one can get.
 * Dmitri: yes. the  [GNAP](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-gnap-core-protocol/) abstract the signing part so that both DPOP or HTTP-Signaure can be used.  
  Still the Signing HTTP messages protocol does not do authentication, just a part of it. It just does message signing. 
 * Henry: is this not the minimal requirement for authentication in this view? Would tying a request to a signature not be the minimum? (The UML diagram shows how this can be extended to Age Credentials, by adding an extra field in the HTTP header pointing to such a Verfiable Claim)
 * Dmitri: There is more to authentication, as can be seen in the GNAP spec. (some statement about authentication being ... metadata discovery... client discovery...)
 * Henry: I need to research that conception of authentication a bit more. It could be that we are here dealing with a simple semantic difference.
