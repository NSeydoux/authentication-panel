This specification uses the terms "Credential", "Verifiable Credential",
"Issuer" and "Presentation" defined by Verifiable Credentials Data Model 1.0
[VC], the terms "Access Token", "Authorization Code", "Authorization Endpoint",
"Authorization Grant", "Authorization Server", "Client Authentication", "Client
Identifier", "Client Secret", "Grant Type", "ID Token", "Implicit Flow",
"Protected Resource", "Redirection URI", "Refresh Token", "Resource Owner",
"Resource Server", "Response Type", and "Token Endpoint" defined by OAuth 2.0
[RFC6749], the terms "Claim Name", "Claim Value", "JSON Web Token (JWT)", "JWT
Claims Set", and "Nested JWT" defined by JSON Web Token (JWT) [JWT], the terms
"Header Parameter" and "JOSE Header" defined by JSON Web Signature (JWS) [JWS],
the term "User Agent" defined by RFC 2616 [RFC2616], and the terms
"Authentication", "Authentication Request", "Authorization Code Flow", "Claim",
"End-User", "Entity", "Identifier", "Identity", "Implicit Flow", "OpenID
Provider (OP)", "Relying Party (RP)", "Validation" and "Verification" defined by
[OpenID Connect Core
1.0](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#Terminology) [OIDC].

##### entity
As defined by [OIDC]:

> Something that has a separate and distinct existence and that can be
> identified in a context. An End-User is one example of an Entity.

##### claim
As defined by [OIDC]:

> Piece of information asserted about an Entity.

##### identifier
As defined by [OIDC]:

> Value that uniquely characterizes an Entity in a specific context.

A [Web ID] or a [DID] is an example of a globally unique, non-pairwise
pseudonymous identifier.

##### controller
A person ([end-user]), group or organization that is responsible for an
[entity], and controls that entity's [identifier].

##### identifier document
A machine-readable document, obtainable by resolving a Web ID or DID
[identifier], that contains statements and metadata about the Entity being
identified. Typically, it contains cryptographic materials such
as public keys, links to service endpoints and authorized [OpenID Connect
Providers] (OPs), and other attributes that are helpful for purposes of
[authentication].

A Web ID Profile, and a DID Document, are both examples of identifier documents.

##### end-user
As defined by [OIDC]:

> Human participant.

##### identity
As defined by [OIDC]:

> Set of attributes related to an entity.

Here, identity specifically refers to a combination of an [identifier], and a
corresponding [identifier document] that is obtainable by resolving that
identifier.

##### authentication
As defined by [OIDC]:

> Process used to achieve sufficient confidence in the binding between the
> entity and the presented identity.

##### authentication flow
[OpenID Connect] built on top of OAuth 2's Authorization Grants, and
introduced the concept of Authentication Flow - a process where a [client] can
use a valid grant (such as the Implicit Grant, Authorization Code Grant, or
others) to perform [authentication].

The end result of any successful authentication flow is that the client
performing it receives one or more credentials from the [identity provider]. In
the case of classic OpenID Connect flows, those credentials are typically either
the [id token], an [access token] specific to a particular resource server, or
both.

In addition, OpenID Connect provides a way for a [relying party] to request
arbitrary [claims] or [credentials] inside the ID Token. In particular, this
specification uses that mechanism to allow a  [relying party] to request one or
more reusable credentials that enable audience-constrained [protected resource
requests] to multiple unaffiliated [resource servers] (see section [Multi
Resource Server (Multi-RS) Use Case] for more details).

##### Web ID
A globally unique [identifier] (typically an HTTPS URL) for an [entity], that
can be resolved to a Web ID Profile document.

##### user-agent
As defined by RFC 2616 [RFC2616]. Often, a formal name for a web browser. Note
that this is often separate from a [client] application (in many cases, client
apps written in Javascript run inside the browser).

##### resource controller
An [entity] with administrative permissions to a resource (e.g. `acl:Control`
access mode in the case of [WAC]). Alternatively, the [entity] in control of the
[resource server] (such as a [Solid pod] or storage space) in which the resource
resides.

Similar to the OAuth 2 and
[UMA 2](https://docs.kantarainitiative.org/uma/wg/rec-oauth-uma-grant-2.0.html)
concept of "resource owner", the resource controller MAY be an [end-user]
(natural person) or MAY be a non-human entity treated as a person for limited
legal purposes (legal person), such as a corporation.

Note the use of "controller" as opposed to "owner"; this specification (and
Solid in general), has no notion of owner.

A given resource can have zero, one, or multiple resource controllers.

##### protected resource
A resource to which access is constrained by an appropriate authorization
mechanism (such as Web Access Control [WAC] rules or Authorization Capabilities
[zCAP]).

##### client
An application, service, bot, or other software entity interacting with a
protected resource hosted by a [resource server] on behalf of a [requesting
party]. The term "client" does not imply any particular implementation
characteristics (such as whether the application executes on a server, a
desktop, inside a web browser, or on other devices).

The client is an [entity] in its own right, possessing an [identifier], and in
some cases, a corresponding [identifier document] containing client metadata.

##### requesting party
As defined by [UMA2]:

An [entity] (natural or legal person) that uses a [client] to seek access to a
[protected resource]. The requesting party may or may not be the same party as
the [resource controller].

##### Solid storage
A server compliant with the [Solid Specification] that acts as a [resource
server] (RS).

##### resource server (RS)
As defined by [OAuth2]:

> The server hosting the protected resources, capable of accepting and
> responding to protected resource requests

##### protected resource request
A request by a [client] to a [protected resource], carrying [authentication] or
authorization [credentials] such as an OAuth 2 Access Token, a Verifiable
Credential, or Proof of Possession token.

##### relying party (RP)
As defined by [OIDC]:

> OAuth 2.0 Client application requiring End-User Authentication and Claims
> from an OpenID Provider.

The [client] needs [authentication] related [claims]/[credentials] for UI
reasons (to display a user name and icon to indicate that theyâ€™re logged in, for
example), but also in order to present those credentials to the [resource
server] when making a [protected resource request]).

##### OpenID Provider (OP)
Also known as an Identity Provider (IdP) or the Authorization Server (AS).

As defined by [OIDC]:

> OAuth 2.0 Authorization Server that is capable of Authenticating the End-User
> and providing Claims to a Relying Party about the Authentication event and
> the End-User.
