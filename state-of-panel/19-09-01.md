# State of the Authentication Panel (19-09-01)
I’ve gone through the github issues and combined them with things I remember being discussed elsewhere and compiled a list of decisions that will need to be made. For each decision I’ve listed the background, as well as pros and cons for each one if there was enough discussion to warrant that.

If there are any I left out please feel free to add them.

## RS issuing its own token vs always using the token from the OP

Discussion here: https://github.com/solid/authentication-panel/issues/12, and https://github.com/solid/authentication-panel/issues/1

Background:

The current paradigm for constructing a token is the PoP tokens (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7800) and in the future it looks like we might move to DPoP tokens (https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-fett-oauth-dpop-02) as DPoP is more up to date. Both of these techniques work by forming consensus between a client and an authentication server (AS) over a token, but the Resource Server (RS) is not included in that flow.

@zenmont proposes an addition to this flow (https://github.com/zenomt/webid-auth-protocol#webid-oidc-proof-of-possession-operation) that would allow the RS to issue its own access tokens.

RS issuing its own token
 - Pros:
    - “compatible with the kinds of OAuth infrastructure likely to be deployed in enterprises.”(https://github.com/solid/authentication-panel/issues/1#issue-479324410)
    - Follows the OAuth model better in that “the client doesn't have standing to make the access tokens for an unrelated resource server. this right belongs to the resource server's authorization server.” (https://github.com/solid/authentication-panel/issues/12)
    - “the server chooses the validity period of the access token according to its security and operational requirements.” This will allow the resource server to revoke the token. (https://github.com/solid/authentication-panel/issues/12)
    - “the server can choose the format of the token to be optimal for its implementation and intended scale of operation." (https://github.com/solid/authentication-panel/issues/12)
    - “the multiple cryptographic and network steps involved in identity verification need only be done when new tokens are issued.“ (https://github.com/solid/authentication-panel/issues/12)
    - “the [resource] server can support multiple methods for obtaining an access token” (https://github.com/solid/authentication-panel/issues/12)
 - Cons:
    - “it requires an extra serialized HTTP transaction (to the authorization server) when a new access token is required for resources in a protection space.” (https://github.com/solid/authentication-panel/issues/12)
    - There is not currently an official draft spec submitted to a standardizing body. (Possibly incorrect statement made by Jackson)

Just DPoP Tokens
 - Pros:
    - Supported by a draft standard (https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-fett-oauth-dpop-02)
    - No need for additional requests to obtain a new token.
    - The RS can revoke a token simply by refusing to honor it (https://github.com/solid/authentication-panel/issues/1#issuecomment-520582222)
    - In practice, the client does not need to know when a token truly expires as almost every client just asks for a refresh when a token stops working without looking at its expiration (Comment from Justin Richer)
 - Cons
    - The RS’s behaviour could differ from the information inside the token.
    - Doesn’t align with traditional OAuth
    - The resource server can't revoke a token through denying a refresh.

## Allow the Implicit Flow or ban it

Discussion here: https://github.com/solid/authentication-panel/issues/14

Background:

The OAuth Implicit Grant (https://auth0.com/docs/flows/concepts/implicit) is vulnerable to Cross Side Scripting attacks, but is still an OAuth standard. The Authorization Code Grant with PKCE (https://auth0.com/docs/flows/concepts/auth-code-pkce) is used for the same use case as the Implicit Grant but is not vulnerable to XSS

Pros/Cons of removing it:
 - Pros:
    - Ensures that no Solid compliant client or server uses this grant
 - Cons:
    - Some app developers may be used to using this grant and dislike its removal in the Solid spec
    - Keeping the implicit grant would make Solid’s OAuth more in line with traditional OAuth

## Alternative Protocols for resolving WebIds

Discussion here: https://github.com/solid/authentication-panel/issues/16

Background:

Currently in the WebID spec (https://www.w3.org/2005/Incubator/webid/spec/identity/#the-webid-http-uri) limits disco limits discovery to the http (or https) protocol. However, there are other possibilities for discovery including but not limited to:
 - IPFS (https://ipfs.io/) a distributed file system that could resolve to turtle documents.
 - Decentralized Identifiers - DID (https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-spec/) a collection of different identifiers with a common interface. Some supported ecosystems can be seen here (https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-method-registry/). Note the DID does include IPFS.

 - Pros:
    - Can handle cases where developers do not want to depend on DNS
    - In the case of DID, would allow a flexible interface to potentially support any future identity system.
 - Cons:
    - Diverges from the WebID standard
    - Resource servers would need to implement another protocol

## Self-signed Strategies
Discussion here: https://github.com/solid/authentication-panel/issues/11

Background:

There has been some debate about self-signed strategies that depend on a user holding their own private key. Previously WebID-TLS handled this, but due to poor UX support among web-browsers, and extra complexities for pod providers when setting up servers, it seems as if we’re moving away from that. OIDC supports a self-issued identity (https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#SelfIssued), however it would require some modification to work with Solid

Just supporting OIDC in the spec (no self-signed strategies)
 - Pros
    - It’s simple and there’s only one protocol resource servers must implement
    - Wouldn’t need to create a new standard
 - Cons
    - No support for self-signed keys

Bring back WebID-TLS, baby
 - Pros
    - Solid has a history with WebID-TLS
    - It will make one specific person very happy
 - Cons
    - Poor UX support with Web-Browsers
    - Requires special configurations if operating through proxies making Pod Provider’s jobs more difficult.

Use a modified oidc self-signed flow
 - Pros
    - More in line with OIDC than WebID-TLS
    - Allows for self-signed tokens
 - Cons
    - Requires the creation of another standard
    - Resource servers still need to handle a slightly different token.
    
HTTP Signatures
 - Pros:
    - it's widely used as authentication in the Fediverse
    - it's not as complex as DID
 - Cons:
    - Like WebID-TLS, HTTP Sig as it currently stands identifies the User /but not/ the app

## Authentication of IoT Devices
Discussion: https://github.com/solid/authentication-panel/issues/8

Background:

There is some preliminary discussion around authenticating with IoT devices. This could be solved as simply as the client credentials grant or might be dependent on the Solid notification system.

## Broker Pattern
Discussion: https://github.com/solid/authentication-panel/issues/5

Background:

A broker pattern has been proposed as a technique that would allow traditional oidc systems (like Google) to be used with Solid. This would involve a Broker acting as a middleman to provide all the new features that are needed for the Solid environment.

 - Pros:
    - Would allow any traditional system to be compatible
 - Cons:
    - Adds another entity (the broker) that must be trusted by the user
    - Might be confusing to a user who thinks they’re logging in with one identity provider, but really it’s using the broker as the identity provider.

## Things that have yet to be discussed
 - Offline Support
 - Joint Tokens
 - Swapping/using multiple Identities
